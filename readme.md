# PSWriteHTML - PowerShell Module

`PSWriteHTML` is PowerShell Module to generate beautiful HTML reports, pages, emails without any knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. To get started basics PowerShell knowledge is required. `PSWriteHTML` is a fork of [ReportHTML](https://github.com/azurefieldnotes/ReportHTML/) module. I've forked [ReportHTML](https://github.com/azurefieldnotes/ReportHTML/) due to it being outdated and not maintained. I also wanted to address some problems it had and add more features. As it stands `PSWriteHTML` is a complete rewrite. Make sure to read blog posts provided to understand the concepts and how you can use `PSWriteHTML` for your own needs.

  - [3rd Party Libraries](#3rd-party-libraries)

## How to install

While you can take sources and use it from here, **PSWriteHTML** actually is composed of multiple other of my modules. To get it up and running you will need ***PSSharedGoods**, and **PSSharedGoods** will need **Connectimo** and **PSWriteColor**. While **Connectimo** or **PSWriteColor** aren't needed for **PSWriteHTML**, **PSSharedGoods** uses them for some of the commands and it will fail without them. You can get all that from sources but if you **just want** to use my modules you should use the `Install-Module` command. It's available in PowerShell 5.1. As an added bonus when I publish modules to **PowerShellGallery** I remove any junk, minimize modules to a single file which makes them faster to load and use. I really encourage you to use the module from PowerShellGallery and treat **GitHub** as a highly development version. Since version 0.0.61 when **PSWriteHTML** is published every dependency is baked into **PSWriteHTML**. That means you don't need to download any other modules unless you want to contribute to this project.

### Installing

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSWriteHTML -AllowClobber -Force
```

Force and AllowClobber aren't necessary but they do skip errors in case some appear.

### Updating

```powershell
Update-Module -Name PSWriteHTML
```

That's it. Whenever there's a new version you simply run the command and you can enjoy it. Remember, that you may need to close, reopen the PowerShell session if you have already used the module before updating it.

**The important thing** is if something works for you on production, keep using it till you test the new version on a test computer. I do changes that may not be big, but big enough that auto-update will break your code. For example, small rename to a parameter and your code stops working! Be responsible!

Dependencies: **PSSharedGoods**, **PSWriteColor** and **Connectimo** are only used during development. When published to PSGallery / Releases it's a merged release without any dependencies.

  - [x] Added `New-HTMLQRCode` to provide HTML based QR codes
- 0.0.123 - 2020.12.23
  - [x] **Potentially Breaking Changes**
    - [x] Removed custom Headings (H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6) -> `New-HTMLHeading` still works just using defaults
      - [x] It was totally inconsistent between H1-H6, probably needs new CSS for those later on that will be consistent and inline with other code
    - [x] Removed H7 heading totally - it got there by some copy paste from internet
    - [x] Removed custom Horizontal Line (HR) -> `New-HTMLHorizonalLine` still works just using defaults
      - [x] Not looking good, the default one looks better, more consitent but may need some work in the future
    - [x] `New-HTMLLogo` is now marked as obsolete. It was there from day one but it's not really customizable. New way will be given sometime in the future
      - [x] It still works, CSS code is only added when it's used
    - [x] Removed custom link highlights CSS. Not sure if it was ever used, hopefully not. May come back in future in better form
    - [x] When `EmailBody` is used it will no longer put `JavaScript` or `CSS` inside HTML for advanced features such as DataTables, or anything that used to be there
      - [x] This is to make sure EMAIL HTML is as small as possbile
      - [x] JavaScript in emails won't work in 90% of cases and it would just add to the junk in HTML
      - [x] However if EmailBody is used within `Email` and `AttachSelf` is used it will generate same HTML using full JS/CSS code
      - [x] This ensures that self attach should work as it used to, at the same time providing small HTML in email
    - [x] JavaScript/CSS is now marked as safe for email or normal HTML reports/pages. What that means some CSS/JS is marked only as being added to Email or vice versa.
  - [x] **Improvements to CSS**
    - [x] The goal of PSWriteHTML is to get into state where only really nessecary code is added. Less CSS is now included by default
    - [x] Hopefully there are no major problems from those changes
    - [x] The default margin for all elements should be `5px`, however when used within email it will be set to `0px`
      - [ ] This mainly is important for Images/Text/Headings but all other html objects such as tables and so on, also are supposed to have `5px` margin
    - [x] It would seem `Roboto Condensed` or other fonts defined in font-family across code were never used and defaults were kicking in
      - [x] I've now fixed it so `Roboto Condensed` is used when `Online` mode
      - [x] In `Offline` mode it will still go back to `Sans-Serif` (usually `Arial`)
      - [x] I've removed other `font-families` from multiple CSS files to make it visually consistent
      - [ ] May need to be revisited if `Roboto Condensed` is best choice
    - [x] Update to `FontsAwesome` from 5.14 to 5.15.1
    - [x] Update to `FontsAwesome` to work offline
      - [x] Unfortunetly this means 500KB file size in CSS module size and output HTML file is 500KB bigger
      - [x] I'm skipping including of TTF/SVG/EOT types as WOFF and WOFF2 should be enough for modern browsers
  - [x] **Other changes**
    - [x] Changed Tables `row height` to fit more data
    - [x] Changed Tables `noscript` version (email + no javascript) to fit more how DataTables looks like
    - [x] Improved HTMLTable with `Simplify` switch positioning
    - [x] `New-HTML` added parameter `AddComment` - by default comments are not added to code now
    - [x] Added `link` preloading for styles - not sure if it will help but why not
    - [x] Fix for `New-DiagramOptionsLinks` setting lenght which would have resultant html error
    - [x] `EmailTextBox` renamed to `New-HTMLTextBox`. `EmailTextBox` added as alias to that command
    - [x] Added `Format` and `Minify` switches to `New-HTML` and `EmailBody`. Those will only be working if [PSParseHTML](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSParseHTML) is installed.
      - [ ] `PSParseHTML` is not installed by default and you need to install it separatly `Install-Module PSParseHTML`. There is no intention of bundling it at this moment.
      - [ ] **Known issue**: Removes comment required for `Internet Explorer` javascript to not prompt when using as local file
    - [x] Improved `New-HTMLTimelineItem` generated HTML when no color is used
    - [x] Added `Enable-HTMLFeature` to bring JS/CSS even if it's not used
    - [x] `Calendars` & `DataTables` & `Diagrams` should now resize/fit properly on Global Tab change
    - [x] `Calendars` & `DataTables` & `Diagrams` are now resize/fit properly on Wizard Step Change
    - [x] `Calendars` & `DataTables` & `Diagrams` are now resize/fit properly on Tab Panel Tab Change
    - [x] Tracks all `tables` with `Fixed Headers`/`Footers` and `disables`/`enables` them on `tab switch`/`wizard step` switch / `tab panel` switch
  - [x] **Diagram Changes**
    - [x] `New-DiagramLink` - added `SmoothType`, `SmoothForceDirection` and `SmoothRoundness`
    - [x] `New-DiagramLink` - fixed `FontAlign` which was using wrong `validateset`.
    - [x] `Diagrams` should now fit properly upon changing tabs. It used to hide outside of screen.
  - [x] **Library updates**
    - [x] Update of `Apex Charts` to 3.23.0
    - [x] Update of `VisJS` to 8.5.5
- 0.0.122 - 2020.11.18
  - [x] Added `New-ChartDataLabel` currently supported in `New-ChartTimeLine` only
  - [x] Improvements `New-ChartTimeLine` - added by Splaxi [#170](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML/pull/170) - Thank you (WIP)
  - [x] Added `New-ChartToolTip` currently supported in `New-ChartTimeLine` only - added by Splaxi [#170](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML/pull/170) - Thank you (WIP)
  - [x] Improvements `New-ChartAxisY`
  - [x] Added parameter for `EmailBody`,`New-HTMLText`, `New-HTMLSpanStyle` - `LineHeight`. This allows for controling line height.
- 0.0.121 - 2020.11.15
  - [x] Added `Accordion` (alpha)
    - [x] `New-HTMLAccordion`
    - [x] `New-AccordionItem`
  - [x] Fix for `New-HTMLDiagram` to disable loader if physics is disabled, as diagram wouldn't load, and loader is not nessecary
  - [x] Fix for `New-HTMLDiagram` to load icons properly in Chrome, IE still requires press
  - [ ] VisNetwork update from `8.5.2` to `8.5.3`
- 0.0.120 - 2020.11.07
  - [x] Fixes partially `New-HTMLTable -FixedFooter` issue [#166](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML/issues/166)
  - [x] ApexChart update 3.20 to 3.20.1
  - [x] VisNetwork update 8.4.1 to 8.5.2
  - [x] VisTimeLine update 7.3.7 to 7.4.2
- 0.0.119 - 2020.10.28
  - [x] Added ability to use nested lists in `New-HTMLList`,`EmailList`
- 0.0.118 - 2020.10.27
  - [x] Improvements to tab switching very fast which could cause an error [#126 DATATABLE warning - Cannot reinitialize DataTable](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML/issues/126)
  - [ ] Added UseDefaultCredential for `EmailServer`
- 0.0.117 - 2020.10.25
  - [x] Fix for issue when Charts are used with Diagrams
  - [x] `ApexCharts` update to 3.22 from 3.20.2
  - [x] `Vis.js` update to 8.4.1 from 8.3.2
  - [x] Small update to `New-HTMLList` with `Reversed` parameter
  - [x] Fix for missing responsive button for `New-HTMLTable`
  - [x] Updates to offline `DataTables` library
- 0.0.116 - 2020.10.21
  - [x] Charts improvement for `Flex` usage (doesn't require `Panel` anymore for positioning)
- 0.0.115 - 2020.10.21
  - [x] Updates to DataStore Javascript
- 0.0.114 - 2020.10.20
  - [x] Small fix to `New-HTMLTable` with DataStore `JavaScript`
- 0.0.113 - 2020.10.19
  - [x] `New-HTMLTable` - changes/improvements/adds
    - [x] Reworked JS/CSS loading for DataTables. It should now load less JS/CSS code by default making HTML smaller and more readable especially if not using all features
      - [ ] Some more work in this area is required. Small breaking change was introduced
    - [x] **Breaking Change** - Renamed `DisableColumnReorder` to `EnableColumnReorder`
      - [ ] The reason for this is that the functionality is most likely used by very few people if at all
      - [ ] This, in turn, allows me to load JS/CSS for ColumnReordering only when someone requests for this functionality
    - [x] Added `EnableRowReorder`
    - [x] Added `EnableKeys` (excel like movement) to `New-HTMLTable`. Probably could add more options for this via nested `New-TableXXX`
    - [x] Added `PagingLength` to `New-HTMLTable`. This improves `PagingOptions` / `DisablePaging`.
      - If user doesn't set Paging Length it will use defaults
      - If user doesn't set Paging Options it will use default `@(15, 25, 50, 100)`
      - If user doesn't set Paging Length, but sets different Paging Options such as `@(5,10,15)`, initial paging length will be set to lowest value `5`
      - If user sets paging options and sets paging length it will set as requested
    - [x] Added `EnableScroller` to `New-HTMLTable`. This improves `ScrollY`. It allows to load data as it appears rather than loading everything. Should be plenty useful in JavaScript DataStore for large datasets
    - [ ] Enabling Scroller doesn't require ScrollY enablement, but it will use ScrollSizeY default 500px. You can change it tho.
    - [x] Added `EnableAutoFill` to `New-HTMLTable`
    - [x] Improved `New-HTMLTable` to load only required CSS/JS (hopefully nothing will be broken)
    - [x] Updated `Out-HTMLView` with all new and old parameters to keep it synced with same the features as `New-HTMLTable` - hopefully, I didn't break anything
    - [x] Updated some `DataTables` JS/CSS versions
    - [ ] `New-HTMLTableOption` allows now to define `BoolAsString`, `NumberAsString` and `DateTimeFormat`
      - [ ] This only works in `JavaScript` and `AjaxJSON` datastore.
      - [ ] This allows one to better control how they want their bools, numbers, and DateTime displayed
      - [ ] For example: `New-HTMLTableOption -DateTimeFormat "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" -BoolAsString`

  - **Notes**
    - [x] `UTF8` will be set by default for `HTML`. `Email` will pick content encoding from `HTML`
      - [x] It was already set for `HTML` for `charset` so just making sure it's all the same
    - [x] Encoding parameter for `EmailOption` and `Email` are DEPRECATED
      - [x] Whatever you set there doesn't matter - it will always be set to `UTF8`. From my tests setting it to anything else messes up display in some clients
      - [x] While not really breaking change, just thought I would make sure people are aware
      - [x] The reason is HTML was always `UTF8` and setting it up on transport level to `Unicode` or other encodings would break things
      - [x] In outlook it wouldn't matter as it would fix it, but in other clients such as Thunderbird it would go nuts

    - [x] Fixes for JavaScript datastore and conditional formatting
- 0.0.97 - 2020.08.29

  - **New/Non-Breaking**
    - [x] New-DiagramNode
      - [ ] Exposed `ArrowsToEnabled`, `ArrowsMiddleEnabled`, `ArrowsFromEnabled`
    - [x] Update to Diagram Height accepting multiple size values
      - [x] This allows for `New-HTMLDiagram -Height 'calc(100vh - 50px)'` which fills whole screen (within section)
      - [x] Or this `New-HTMLDiagram -Height 'calc(100vh - 50px)' -Width '50vw'` although not that useful, as flex fixes most of it
    - [x] Updates `New-DiagramOptionsPhysics` - exposed a bunch of new options plus help
    - [x] Updates `New-DiagramOptionsLayout` - added some help and new options
  - **Updated library**
    - [x] `Vis-network` to 8.2.1
- 0.0.96 - 2020.08.28
  - [x] It seems SearchPanes from DataTables conflict with `New-HTMLDiagram`
    - [x] Separated that library to be added only on demand
- 0.0.95 - 2020.08.27
  - **Notes**
    - I'm reworking CSS model in which PSWriteHTML works allowing for more consistent design and more customization options. This means some breaking changes will happen soon enough.
    - FontSize will be reworked for most commands (as I get to them) to take `[int]` input but also `[string]` input
      - If `[int]` is provided it assumes size given in `px`. If text is provided it takes it as is.
        - If `15` this means `15px`
        - If `15px` this means `15px`
        - If `15pt` this means `15pt`
        - If `'15'` this means `15px` as it will convert to `[int]` first
        - Anything else will be treated as is meaning you know what you are doing
  - **Breaking changes**
    - [x] Default Font Size for everything is `8pt`. This includes:
      - [x] Tabs used to have `15px`. Now by default `8pt`. You will need `New-HTMLTabOption -FontSize '15px'` or `New-HTMLTabOption -FontSize 15` to set default fontsize for Tabs to it's old value (along with other customizations if needed)
      - [x] Inputs for Tables (Filtering) having static `8pt`
  - **Improvements**
    - [x] `New-HTMLMain` - allows customizing font size, font type, background color, and text color globally - this will overwrite defaults as described above
    - [x] Fix TempFilePath for `Email` to work correctly on MacOS/Linux - tnx roberttoups [#146](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML/pull/146)
    - [x] Auto-wrapping of Tabs is enabled - can be disabled via `New-HTMLTabOption`
    - [x] Bunch of options to control wrapping/direction of tabs via `New-HTMLTabOption`
    - [x] Ability to define `RowElements` in `New-HTMLTabOption` to force number of tabs per row
    - [x] Fixed BackgroundColor for `New-HTMLTabOption`

    - [x] Fixed broken `Tab` switching in **Internet Explorer 11**
    - [x] Added basic support for `SearchPane` within `New-HTMLTable`
    - [x] Fixed broken `Tables` refresh on `Tabs` when using named `Tables`
    - [x] Fixed `New-HTMLTable`/`Out-HTMLView` with `-AllProperties` displaying wrong properties for IDictionary objects
    - [x] Fixed `New-HTMLTable` properly displaying string/int and other data if passed as a single value
    - [x] Fixed `New-HTMLTable` properly display ordered dictionary, array of strings, array of singular objects, PSCustomObject with 1 column
    - [x] Fixed `New-HTMLTable` properly displaying column name as `Name` in PowerShell 5.1 when used with int/string
    - [x] Fixed `New-HTMLText` font size was ignored. Also now supports 15, 15px, 15pt as described in notes.
    - [x] Resolves peformance issues by adding new parameter `DataStore` for `New-HTMLTable` to use with large tables
  - **Added cmdlets**
    - [x] `New-HTMLTableStyle`
    - [x] `New-HTMLTableOption` - added to provide `DataStore` parameter which globally sets required store, may be used for other things in future
    - [x] `New-ChartTimeLine` - added basic support for TimeLine Charts
  - **Renamed cmdlets** (non-breaking change via aliases)
    - [x] `New-HTMLTabOption` -> `New-HTMLTabStyle`
    - [x] `New-HTMLSectionOption` -> `New-HTMLSectionStyle`

        - [x] Before it would try to change from `'&amp;nbsp;` to `<space>` which is wrong. Hopefully, nothing will be broken after that

  - [x] Fix for LOGO in PowerShell Core
  - [x] New-HTMLTable
    - [x] Added ImmediatelyShowHiddenDetails switch - Responsive has the ability to display the details that it has hidden in a variety of different ways. Its default is to allow the end-user to toggle the display by clicking on a row and showing the information in a DataTables child row. At times it can be useful not to require end-user interaction to display the hidden data in a responsive manner, which can be done with the childRowImmediate display type.

## Projects using PSWriteHTML (to give you ideas of what you can do)

- [Statusimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Statusimo) is a PowerShell module that is able to generate a Status Page entirely from PowerShell.
- [Dashimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Dashimo) is a PowerShell module that makes generating Dashboards, nice looking HTML, a breeze.
- [Emailimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Emailimo) is a PowerShell module that makes writing nice looking HTML emails, easy!
- [Out-HTMLView](https://evotec.xyz/out-htmlview-html-alternative-to-out-gridview/) is a PowerShell cross-platform command alternative to Out-GridView

Following external libraries and frameworks are in use. They make `PSWriteHTML` what it is now. This list is dynamic and doesn't cover everything yet.

For colors, you can visit this [online page](https://evotec.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-Colors.html).

## 3rd Party Libraries

**PSWriteHTML** uses some 3rd party libraries to deliver its functionality. It requires those. There are two ways to use it

- With links to CSS/JS which makes code cleaner and easy to see what is happening
- With code inline in HTML which makes HTML much bigger (default, but makes PSWriteHTML usage offline possible)

Below you can find 3rd party libraries being used.
